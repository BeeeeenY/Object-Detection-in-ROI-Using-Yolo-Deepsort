# Object-Detection-in-ROI-Using-Yolo-Deepsort
With the development of Singapore's society and factories, security and safety issues are becoming more critical. With a lack of manpower, people sometimes need to supervise different areas at the same time and intervene in time to stop accidents when they happen.

## What it does
To detect objects in a marked area. Can be used for surveillance purposes, baby care, etc.
## How we built it
1. Color recognition API using KNN classifier
To identify objects colour
Dataset: Color samples
2. Highlight Region Of Interest and detect entrance.
With a script to extract ROI region using mouse event for new inputs
3. Yolo V4 & Deepsort
To identify object & extract object information
Dataset: COCO dataset
